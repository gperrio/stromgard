ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

 It goes without saying that our two-hundred and four 
backers (plus the non-Kickstarter preorders) literally carried The 
Wyrd of Stromgard from small scale, PDF release (if that) to 
existing in the real world as a tangible book. From both of us, 
we cannot thank them deeply enough for supporting us as indie 
creators and taking a chance on Stromgard’s potential. We hope 
that they’ll continue supporting small studios and independent 
creators!

 In particular, many of our backers submitted magical 
weapons and items, as well as adventure front prompts as part 
of our crowdfunding campaign. We had so many outstanding 
and original ideas that we put it to a community poll to choose 
the ‘finalists’. I’d like to thank the community for submitting 
so many amazing ideas and especially thank those who created 
the most popular of the bunch- specifically Logan “Dogface701” 
Collins for the Shard of Bifrost weapon and the inspiration to 
flesh out In the Shadows of Titans as one of the additional 
adventures. Espen Andre Henriksen (aka Essenrik) dreamt up 
the intimidating Tooth of Jörmungandr, a personal favorite and 
immediately a hit in our polls! Also Alexander R. Corbett 
deserves so much thanks for submitting the idea of Undyne’s 
Haft, which I was very excited to add and used it in one of my 
personal campaigns. Also, a profuse thank you to Phillip 
McGregor, who posesses a wealth of knowledge on historical 
arms and armor and who very kindly offered me some assistance 
in dating Stromgard's equipment.

research for specific areas of Stromgard, but the following articles 
were ones I referred to the most:
