Welcome to Stromgard

Strong was he made with the strength of the earth,
With the ice-cold sea, and the blood of swine.

Hyndluljóð, Poetic Edda

 Stromgard as a setting takes most of its inspiration from 
fantastic tales and planar realms described in the Eddas. 
Compiled here is a brief look at the most prominent races of the 
Nine Realms and the most recognizable gods. There is room 
here for endless customization. Add races, add planes, add gods 
that fit the narrative you and your table want to tell. 

 It’s worth mentioning that this section is specifically 
written with a more academic tone to lay out cultural and 
societal norms without commenting on the morality of them. 
Mechanically, Stromgard desires to decouple race from 
alignment as much as possible in the hopes that narrative evil 
is based more on action than on preconception. In the setting 
chapters, my aim is to simply present a dynamic world that can 
easily support intrigue, justice, inequities, and complex systems 
of social expectations that make for powerful narrative impetus.

 The realm of Stromgard sits on the mortal plane, Midgard 
and as such, Stromgard's diverse population consists primarily 
of mortal races- those without divine blood, who will eventually 
wither and die. Typically, these groups are racially insular but 
the general economic situation and interest in other matters keep 
warmongering to a minimum and relationships fairly 

diplomatic. From a large-scale standpoint, at any rate. 
Humans, elves, dwarves, halflings, and gnomes are the most 
populous races in the realms, and most of them interact with 
each other regularly in some form or another. The purveying 
ideals of honor and strength causes most people to judge others 
by their actions before their culture, which has the benefit of 
facilitating usually tolerable rapport with neighbors.
